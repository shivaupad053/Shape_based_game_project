# Shape_based_game_project
I designed and implemented an engaging educational game tailored for students in classes 6 to 12th, aimed at enhancing their understanding of 2D and 3D shapes. The game features a user interface where students can interact with various shapes by clicking on them. It uses object-oriented programming principles.
